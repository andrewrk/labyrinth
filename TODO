Version 0.2.0 (Project 2)
 * normals -> per vertex normals - renders the scene using all per vertex
   normals
    - Normals -> per vertex normals - calculate using average
    - normals -> per vertex normals weighted - calculate using weighted average
 * normal visualization -> On/Off - user can see normal vectors
 * crease angles
    - menu option: crease angle -> 15, 25, 35, Off
    - normals only get averaged at a vertex when the angles between the 
      adjacent triangles is less than then crease angle.
 * shading
    - scene has one single light source (the sun).
        > above but near the edges
        > color has diffuse and specular components 1,1,1
        > no attenuation
    - material options:
        > materials -> diffuse - everything is rendered with same material
          that has a high diffuse and a low emissive component.
        > materials -> specular - everything is rendered with a material that
          has a high specular, high diffuse, and low emissive component
        > materials -> Design - assign different materials to different things
          to make the scene look good
 * ability to move the light source around in realtime
    - left click / right click - rotate the light source around the scene about
      the Y axis
 * navigation1 - View -> Overview
    - left or right cursor - camera rotates around the terrain about the up axis
    - up or down key / a or s key  - camera moves along the z axis
 * navigation2 - View -> First Person
    - up and down - forward and backward
    - left and right - rotate 
    - a and s control elevation over the ground plane 
 * change back to qwerty
 * fix texture coordinates for walls and cylinders

Version 0.2.1
 * MazeView - keep track of textures and delete them when done (memory leak)
