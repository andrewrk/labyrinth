Version 0.2.0 (Project 2)
 * shading
    - scene has one single light source (the sun).
        > above but near the edges
        > no attenuation
    - material options:
        > materials -> diffuse - everything is rendered with same material
          that has a high diffuse and a low emissive component.
        > materials -> specular - everything is rendered with a material that
          has a high specular, high diffuse, and low emissive component
        > materials -> Design - assign different materials to different things
          to make the scene look good
 * ability to move the light source around in realtime
    - left click / right click - rotate the light source around the scene about
      the Y axis
 * crease angles
    - menu option: crease angle -> 15, 25, 35, Off
    - normals only get averaged at a vertex when the angles between the 
      adjacent triangles is less than then crease angle.
 * change back to qwerty
 * fix texture coordinates for walls and cylinders
 * bug: the dude is red and there is a line going from the girl to him
 * bug: the animation stopped
 * bug: surface normals not unified

Version 0.2.1
 * MazeView - keep track of textures and delete them when done (memory leak)
