Version 0.2.0 (Project 2)
 * crease angles
    - menu option: crease angle -> 15, 25, 35, Off
    - normals only get averaged at a vertex when the angles between the 
      adjacent triangles is less than then crease angle.
 * bug: the dude is red and there is a line going from the girl to him
 * bug: the animation stopped
 * bug: surface normals not unified
 * bug: weighted average is dubious

Version 0.2.1
 * MazeView - keep track of textures and delete them when done (memory leak)
